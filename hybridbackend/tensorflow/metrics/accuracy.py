  r'''Calculates how often `predictions` matches `labels`.

  The `accuracy` function creates two local variables, `total` and
  `count` that are used to compute the frequency with which `predictions`
  matches `labels`. This frequency is ultimately returned as `accuracy`: an
  idempotent operation that simply divides `total` by `count`.

  For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
  `update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `accuracy`.
  Internally, an `is_correct` operation computes a `Tensor` with elements 1.0
  where the corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels` match and 0.0
  otherwise. Then `update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the
  product of `weights` and `is_correct`, and it increments `count` with the
  reduced sum of `weights`.

  If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

  Args:
    labels: The ground truth values, a `Tensor` whose shape matches
      `predictions`.
    predictions: The predicted values, a `Tensor` of any shape.
    weights: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
      `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must
      be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
    metrics_collections: An optional list of collections that `accuracy` should
      be added to.
    updates_collections: An optional list of collections that `update_op` should
      be added to.
    name: An optional variable_scope name.

  Returns:
    accuracy: A `Tensor` representing the accuracy, the value of `total` divided
      by `count`.
    update_op: An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables
      appropriately and whose value matches `accuracy`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if
      `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if
      either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or
      tuple.
    RuntimeError: If eager execution is enabled.
